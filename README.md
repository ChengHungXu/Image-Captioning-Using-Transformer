Author: Lim Yi Jing, Chiam Yu Wei, Cheng Hung Xu, Lee Jean Sean

This repository is about an implementation of image captioning using the Transformer Model.

In this project, we are going to build an image captioning model using Transformer 
Architecture. The dataset we used is an open-source dataset: Flickr 30K Dataset. This 
dataset contains 31,000 images collected from Flickr, together with 5 reference 
sentences provided by human annotators.
